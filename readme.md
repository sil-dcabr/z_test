<Z test for a life expectancy brief examination>

<Description>
This code aims to check if the mean deceased age of 
former inhabitants of brazilian city of Curitiba matches the national
life expectancy. 

For this goal, both normality and z tests for populational mean 
are performed over age variable and within R programming language. 
Due to the distribution of the data, it's been decided to 
perform z test considering male population only. 

It has to be emphasized that this investigation and its manual
collection of data has been made with academic purposes only.

<IDE and libraries>
In order to run the code, R studio and the following packages
will be required:
tidyverse;

BSDA;
ggplot2.

ibge.gov.br website and at this date corresponds to 77 years (73.6 years for 
male population).

All the data about the deceased inhabitants have been collected
at obituarios.curitiba.pr.gov.br/publico/falecimentos.aspx during a certain 
period of 2022 and based on a random dates selection.
